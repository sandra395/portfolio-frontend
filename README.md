**UK Stays** is the frontend of a property booking platform (AirbNC), connecting to a custom backend API. It provides a user experience for browsing, reviewing, and booking properties.
Currently, the app uses hardcoded user and host IDs for demonstration purposes.

The frontend is built with React, follows a component-based design, and uses React Router for page navigation. The design is mobile-first with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring smooth interactions and a pleasant user experience.

**Key Features**

‚Ä¢	**Property Listings:** Browse all available properties.

‚Ä¢ **Stay Search & Filtering:** Quickly narrow down results by Property Type, Sort by Price (low to high or high to low), 
  and apply a custom Price Filter using a condition (<, >, or =) followed by a user-specified price value.
  
‚Ä¢	**Property Details & Reviews:** View detailed information and reviews for each property.

‚Ä¢	**Add Reviews:** Submit reviews for properties you have visited.

‚Ä¢	**Bookings:** Book properties and view upcoming bookings.
